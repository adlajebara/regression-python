# Regression_Python
I wrote this code while taking a summer course at Chalmers university.


## How to run it: 

To compute a polynomial of degree four: 
```bash
python3 numpy_regression.py dataset3.txt 4
```

To compute a polynomial of degree two: 
```bash
python3 numpy_regression.py dataset1.txt 2
```
